lasMD is a large-scale, masively parallelized code for simulating laser-ablation of metallic targets, based on the IMD code
main features:<br/>

-hybrid MD/two-temperature-model approach<br/>
-the transport of electronic heat is calculated on a finite-difference grid superimposed with the MD-simulation box, accounting for diffusion and advection<br/>
-features wide-range models for the thermal conductivity, electron-phonon coupling and ther permittivity<br/>
-includes a 1D Helmholtz-solver, a 1D Maxwell-solver and a 2D-Maxwell solver, giving a full-wave solution for the laser-matter interaction<br/>
-includes non-reflective boundary conditions in order to absorb laser-induced shock-waves at the rear side of the target material<br/>
