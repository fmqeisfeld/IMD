lasMD is a large-scale, masively parallelized code for simulating laser-ablation of metallic targets
main features:
-hybrid MD/two-temperature-model approach
-the transport of electronic heat is calculated on a finite-difference grid superimposed with the MD-simulation box, accounting for diffusion and advection
-features wide-range models for the thermal conductivity, electron-phonon coupling and ther permittivity
-includes a 1D Helmholtz-solver, a 1D Maxwell-solver and a 2D-Maxwell solver, giving a full-wave solution for the laser-matter interaction
-includes non-reflective boundary conditions in order to absorb laser-induced shock-waves at the rear side of the target material
